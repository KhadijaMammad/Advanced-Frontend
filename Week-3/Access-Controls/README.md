🎨 UI / Design Notes

Colour palette: Use a white background, with text and accent colours in green (#27ae60 or similar) or brown (#8d6e63 or similar) to maintain clean and natural tones — as you prefer.

Logo placement: In the navbar, on the white background; ensure good contrast.

Avoid dark or overly saturated colours to prevent eye-strain.

Animations: Use subtle animations (fade, slide) for components like sliders, page transitions, hover effects — but keep them performant and accessible.

Typography: Use clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Poppins, Roboto) for readability.

Spacing & layout: Maintain consistent spacing, responsive breakpoints, and mobile-first approach.
