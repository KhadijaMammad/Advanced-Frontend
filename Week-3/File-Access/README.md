🎨 Design & UI Notes

Color palette: white background with green (#27ae60) or brown (#8d6e63) highlights.

Typography: clean, readable fonts.

Animations: use subtle fade/slide transitions for sliders and hover effects — keep them light and performant.

Avoid dark or oversaturated colors — the goal is a simple, modern, and elegant look.

Consistent spacing and layout using Flexbox/Grid ensures a clean responsive design.

💡 Good to Know

Currently, this is a frontend-only application. Backend or authentication can be added later.

Keep components small, reusable, and modular.

Update routing when adding new pages or sections.

If the app grows, consider using React Context or Redux for state management.

Use ESLint and Prettier (optional) to maintain clean, consistent code.

When deploying, handle any environment variables securely if APIs are integrated later.
